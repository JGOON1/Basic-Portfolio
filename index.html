    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hello, my name is John, I am currently attending the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.
        I hope gain enough knowledge to become a full stack developer. The reason why I attended
        a coding bootcamp is because I like learn in a classroom setting. 
    </p>
    <p>I am from Lancaster, Pennsylvania and now currently living in Philadelphia.
        Something things that I like to do is hiking, biking, and playing volleyball.
        I graduated from Temple University with a Bachelors in Geology.
